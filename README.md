# ML_projects_on_own_language_learning_dataset
This repository contains all of my ML projects done with use of my own language learning data set; the data set is a time series with the number of minutes spent learning  each day from March 2019 until November 2022.

The main file containing EDA, data preparation and models development can be found here:
https://github.com/OlgaMCgithub/ML_projects_on_own_language_learning_dataset/blob/main/recall_metric_binary_classification_lang_analysis_0-1%20target.ipynb

The excel files compose the dataset used for model training and the pkl files are serilized developed models ready for reuse on unseen data.

In this project, among others, I used: 
DBSCAN, LogistingRegression, SVM, XGBoost, AdaBoost, histograms, boxplots, time series plots, standard scaler, PCA, KBest, pipelines, GridSearchCV,  validation curves, pickle,
metrics: recall, roc_auc, precision, confusion matrix, classification report, VotingClassifier etc.
